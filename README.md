**What need are we addressing? How big is the need?**
India’s healthcare industry is one of the fastest growing sectors and it is expected to reach 
$280 billion by 2020. Indian healthcare delivery system is indeed vast and has huge potential.
It, however, has some loopholes which need to be filled. Some of the important points worth 
mentioning are:
1)  People generally manage their medical records for their lifetime, which is a cumbersome
process as the records are generally in the form of paper documents. Also, a person needs to
submit many documents in order to claim health insurance, visa, and many other things. For
anyone to get medical leave, a separate medical certificate needs to be issued by the doctor,
which is to be submitted to the organization or to get any medical document a person has to
invest a huge amount of time.
2) The doctors having patients staying at distant locations are unable to keep interaction with them
regarding their regular check-ups and vaccination updates.

**We aim to build a complete one-stop solution for all healthcare needs.**

● **Data Aggregation Platform** - We aim to record and manage the health
data of all users so that they can access it whenever they want in a hassle-free and
efficient manner without having to go through the bulky documents written in an alien
language. We will store all our data on the blockchain. It will provide more security,
reliability, and authenticity.<br/>
● **Providing regular medicine/vaccination reminders**- Patients no longer need to remember
the complex schedules at which a particular medicine/vaccine needs to be taken, as we
will be taking care of that responsibility. The user just need to tell us the disease and we
will be suggesting the doses accordingly.<br/>
● **Easier redemption of health insurance claims**##- Insurance is an important part of one’s
life, however, its redemption requires many hectic procedures and a long time. We will
provide a single click health insurance claim and redemption.<br/>
● **One-click medical document verification**- Students generally have to present a medical
certificate for any ill leaves they take and have to visit the doctor to get it done. With our
application, they can request a certificate from the comfort of their homes with a
verifiable authenticity.<br/>
● **Book an appointment** with registered doctors/medical tests at diagnostic
centers- Time is the most important asset. Seeing a doctor or visiting a diagnostic center
generally is a time taking process. But, with this feature, we ensure that you don’t have
to stand in long queues and wait for hours in the doctor’s clinic and diagnostic center.<br/>

**Who are our target customers and why they would use our product?**<br/>

We aim to connect with small clinics, hospital groups, Labs and various treatment cenrtres with patients.
Allowing all these entities to access patient data with patient's consent thus allowing them for better
diagnosis. Also providing various services to patients at same time.<br/>

**How the business will earn revenue ?**<br/>
We will charge the clinics and hospital groups for digitizing the records and maintaing patient data.
We have premium membership that patients can buy to avail our premium services like leave certificates, 
visa documents and various features.<br/>

**How is our solution different from the existing/competitors' product/substitutes?**<br/>
Many attempts have been made by various global companies to solve healthcare issues and
provide a more personalized and hassle-free experience, however, there is still scope for a lot
more development in this sector. There are currently various private and public organizations,
serving in this sector. But, all these organizations are limited to themselves and have not
collaborated under one common umbrella. This causes various problems for patients, as they
need to follow different protocols for each hospital they visit and manage different documents.
However, with our application, we aim at providing a solution to all the healthcare needs of
people from the comfort of their homes with an assurance of efficiency, authenticity, safety, and
security.

Unique features like life-long verified medical record, medicine/vaccination scheduler, easy
insurance claim, one-click medical document verification, AI-enabled diagnosis, etc. (which were
explained earlier) all in one app is not yet provided.<br/>

**What is the Social Impact that our venture can generate?**<br/>
We are trying to ease the work related to the medical sector. There will be some unique features
that are not yet implemented and some features that are already provided by others. People will
no longer have to take care of their life long medical documents, medical documents can be
requested easily, access documents anytime anywhere, easy to claim Insurance, AI-enabled
medicine suggestions for basic needs, anytime anywhere consultation, appointment and
medical tests can be booked easily, regular medical remainders, suggestions for doctors
nearby, etc. will make work related to healthcare easier and time-efficient.<br/>

**What is the current status of the business?**<br/>
Currently we have a demo app that allows doctors and patients to register themselves and allows 
doctors to go through all patients data that they are treating.<br/>
